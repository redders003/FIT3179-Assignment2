    <h1>Australia's Film Industry</h1>
    <p>
      Australia has long been a vibrant player in the global film industry,
      producing both internationally acclaimed films and unique domestic works
      that reflect its rich cultural heritage. From early classics like
      <i>Crocodile Dundee (1986)</i> to global blockbusters like
      <i>The Matrix Reloaded (2003)</i> and <i>The Lego Movie (2014)</i>,
      Australia’s film industry has been influential both in terms of
      storytelling and technical achievements. <br /><br />
      Australia's role in the global box office has grown significantly since
      the late 20th century, particularly as filmmakers, actors, and production
      teams have gained international recognition. Directors like George Miller
      and Baz Luhrmann, as well as stars like Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, and
      Cate Blanchett, have become household names. The country has also become a
      major destination for international film production due to its scenic
      locations, talented workforce, and competitive tax incentives.

      <p>
        Australia does moderately well on the global scale, ranking 15th in
        terms of worldwide box office revenue from domestically produced films
        per film produced domestically. The United States, unsurprisingly, comes
        in first, thanks to Hollywood's domination of the film market. Panama
        interestingly comes in second, despite producing only a few films,
        mainly due to the success of
        <i>Superman (1978)</i>, which was a co-production (joint venture between
        production companies from different countries) between
        Panama, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. New
        Zealand came in third, thanks to the massive international success of
        <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>The Hobbit</i> trilogies, all of
        which were co-productions between New Zealand and the United States.
        <br /><br />The map below visualizes the sum of the worldwide box office
        of domestically produced films, relative to the number of films produced
        in each country, from 1899 to 2024. The countries are shaded according
        to the worldwide box office revenue of domestically produced films, per
        film produced domestically. Darker shades indicate higher box office
        returns, while lighter shades represent lower returns.

      <h2>Australian Box Office</h2>
      <p>
        All of Australia's major box office successes stem from co-productions
        with the United States. Early examples include
        <i>Crocodile Dundee (1986)</i>, <i>Crocodile Dundee 2 (1988)</i>,
        <i>Babe (1995)</i>, and <i>The Matrix (1999)</i>. 2003 was the most
        successful year for Australian films, thanks to
        <i>The Matrix Reloaded</i> becoming (and remaining) the highest grossing
        Australian film of all time, grossing over $738 million worldwide. 2003
        also saw success with <i>Mystic River</i> and <i>Peter Pan</i>, which
        together grossed an additional $252 million worldwide. In more recent
        times, while there are still successful Australian productions at the
        box office (such as <i>The Lego Movie (2014)</i> and
        <i>Peter Rabbit (2018)</i>, which grossed over $467 million and $358
        million worldwide respectively), the general trend is diminishing box
        office returns, coinciding with an increase in the number of Australian
        films being produced. 2023 was a particularly bad year, with the highest
        number of Australian films ever created within a year (122), but only
        grossing a total of $28 million worldwide.<br /><br />
        This bar chart tracks the total worldwide box office earnings of
        Australian films from 1979 to 2024. The visualization is composed of two
        parts: the main bar chart (at the top) that shows the total worldwide
        box office of Australian films for each year, and an interactive
        selection bar (at the bottom) that allows users to focus on a specific
        time range. The year with the highest box office within this range is
        indicated, and the highest-grossing film of that year is also annotated.
        The bars are shaded according to the number of Australian films produced
        within each year, with darker shades indicating a higher number of
        films.

    <!-- Combined Budget and Funding Section -->

      <h2>Australian Film Funding</h2>
      <p>
        Australian film funding comes from a diverse range of sources, including
        government agencies, private investors, and foreign backers. The
        Australian government, through Screen Australia and state-based bodies,
        plays a vital role in supporting films that reflect the nation’s
        culture. However, the largest contributor comes from foreign investors,
        who contributed over $2 billion between 2008 and 2023, often backing
        larger co-productions aimed at international markets. Incentives like
        the Producer Offset (a tax rebate program) have further attracted
        foreign investment, making Australia a key destination for global
        productions. Drama is the most attractive genre for funding, receiving
        over $1.6 billion (33%) of funding from all sources between 2008 and
        2023. <br /><br />
        From 1996 to 2023, the majority of these budgets for Australian films
        have historically been spent domestically, however some years had
        significant spending outside of the country, such as 2003 with over 37%
        of the budget spent outside of Australia. 2022 easily had the highest
        total budget, with over $796 million spent on Australian films, of which
        only $2 million was spent outside Australia.
