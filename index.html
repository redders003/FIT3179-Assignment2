    <h1>Australia's Film Industry</h1>
    <p>Australia has long been a vibrant player in the global film industry, producing both internationally acclaimed
        films and unique domestic works that reflect its rich cultural heritage. From early classics like <i>Crocodile
            Dundee (1986)</i> to global blockbusters like <i>The Matrix Reloaded (2003)</i> and <i>The Lego Movie
            (2014)</i>, Australiaâ€™s film industry has been
        influential both in terms of storytelling and technical achievements.
        <br><br>
        Australia's role in the global box office has grown significantly since the late 20th century, particularly as
        filmmakers, actors, and production teams have gained international recognition. Directors like George Miller and
        Baz Luhrmann, as well as stars like Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, and Cate Blanchett, have become household
        names. The country has also become a major destination for international film production due to its scenic
        locations, talented workforce, and competitive tax incentives.

        <p>The map below visualizes the sum of the worldwide box office of domestically produced films, relative to the
            number of films produced in each country, from 1899 to 2024. The countries are shaded according to the worldwide box
            office revenue per film produced domestically. Darker shades indicate higher box office returns, while lighter shades
            represent lower returns.

        <p>This bar chart tracks the total worldwide box office earnings of Australian films from 1979 to 2024. The visualization is composed of two parts: the main bar chart (at the top) that shows the total worldwide box office of Australian films for each year, and an interactive selection bar (at the bottom) that allows users to focus on a specific time range. 
            The year with the highest box office within this range is indicated, and the highest-grossing film of that year is also annotated.
            The bars are shaded according to the number of Australian films produced within each year, with darker shades indicating a higher number of films.
